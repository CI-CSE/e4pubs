# e4pubs

These are classes that can be accessed online: http://autoproof.sit.org/e4pubs/

Every folder has to contain an `.ecf` and an `.e` file.
In addition it should have a symlink `ln -s ../../comcom/executables/autoproof.py autoproof.py`

In order to update the website one needs to pull the newest version from the webserver at `/var/www/e4pubs`.
